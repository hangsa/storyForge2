# disk-side draft and a runner-side completion reach the same terminal
# status via the same precedence rules. Without the ladder, a draft
# discovered after a force_passed scene would get demoted to completed

# SCENE_WRITE_MAX_RETRIES additional times with growing backoff; only when
# ALL attempts fail do we pause the session with `pause_reason` set so the
# user can intervene via the cockpit banner.
#
# Why 2 retries (3 total attempts): aligns with the existing Fact Guard
# CircuitBreaker.MAX_RETRIES=3 budget, gives the upstream LLM enough slack
# to recover from a transient blip, but doesn't burn the user's token
# budget on a permanently broken prompt. Bug 2026-07-22 proj_a601cee9:

# Row-major queue priority scheme: chapters are processed in chapter_number

# between chapter buckets leaves 998 scene slots plus one archival slot per
# chapter (well above any realistic outline). The archive slot sits after the
# chapter's scenes and before the next chapter's first scene.
#
# Invariants:
#   scene_priority(N, M) < scene_priority(N, M+1)        (within chapter)

#
# Why row-major (and not column-major as before):
#   - Aligns with StoryForge's per-chapter MemoryOS cache (L1/L4/L2 survive
#     across scenes in the same chapter). Column-major thrashes the cache
#     every scene → ~60% extra context-assembly overhead per the design doc.
#   - Net-novel authoring works chapter-by-chapter; writing ch31.scene_4
#     "knows" all of ch31 already exists.
#   - Eliminates the "ch32.scene_1 written before ch31.scene_4" forward-leak

    because the requested scope had nothing left to do" from "everything
    really is done" — without this distinction the API's no_work_to_do
    branch can't tell the user what actually happened (bug 2026-07-17:
    proj_cc4ca4ae saw a misleading "all 33 chapters done" toast when in
    reality the user's stale scope=next_chapter was the blocker).

    `enqueued` is the TOTAL number of NEW queue items added by this call,
    summed across both code paths:
      - `seeded`: scenes added by `_enqueue_for_scope` (the standard
        enqueue path; uses deterministic ids for idempotent dedup).
      - `regenerated_scenes`: scenes re-enqueued for completed chapters
        in scope (the regeneration path; drops old queue items first then
        re-adds via `regenerate_chapter`).
    The two diverge when regeneration kicks in: a fresh start against an
    outline with completed chapters in scope gets `seeded=0` for those
    chapters (regen already added them) but `enqueued>0` once regenerated
    scenes are added.

    `matched` is the total number of unfinished scenes in the requested
    scope (including scenes already in the queue from a previous call).
    The two diverge once seed_queue becomes idempotent: a restart against
    a queue that already holds its target scenes returns enqueued=0 but
    matched>0, which means "nothing new, but there's still work — keep
    running."

    `enqueued` is telemetry-only — the caller's no-work decision uses
    queue length, not enqueued count (see autopilot_loop.py:152).

    Returns the count of scenes promoted. Does NOT persist — the caller
    (seed_queue) writes the updated progress.json once after the loop so
    we don't fsync on every promotion.

    Conservative on missing entries: if `progress` has no entry for the
    chapter at all (chapter never started in progress.json), we don't
    auto-create one. Same for scenes. The reasoning:
      - auto-creating chapter entries would mask bookkeeping bugs
        (e.g. _advance_chapter skipped writing for some reason);
      - the user's outline might have been regenerated AFTER the draft

        precheck or skip cleanly via the outline drift short-circuit.
    The caller can later re-run seed_queue after the chapter advances
    and the progress entry exists, at which point promotion kicks in.

    completed. We only ever promote UP the ladder: a pending scene with a
    draft becomes completed; a force_passed scene with a draft also

    Trust-the-disk promotion: when `projects_dir` is provided, scan
    `chapters/` for draft.md files in the target scope. For each scene
    whose draft exists but progress.json shows it as pending (or has no
    entry at all), promote to completed via the status ladder. This

    progress.json drift).

    current_chapter floor: if `progress.current_chapter` is set and > 1,
    raise the effective start to `current_chapter - 1` so a resume
    doesn't restart from `cfg.start_chapter` when the runner had
    actually advanced further. Honors cfg as a lower bound — if the user
    explicitly asked to start at chapter 5 and current_chapter=8, the
    floor wins (start at 7), but if they asked start=12 and current=8,
    start_chapter=12 still wins.

    Idempotent on QueueItem ids: items with deterministic ids already in

    fallback that was removed in v2.1 left no replacement; out-of-scope

          - Up to SCENE_WRITE_MAX_RETRIES additional attempts on the SAME
            queue item with growing backoff (SCENE_WRITE_RETRY_BACKOFFS).
          - On every retry the queue item is intentionally NOT dropped so
            that `seed_queue()` (idempotent on item ids) cannot re-add a
            duplicate. If the user resumes, the runner picks the same item.
          - Between backoff sleeps we re-check session state — if the user
            paused/stopped during the wait, we abort the retry and return.
        Failure mode (write_scene only):
          - When all attempts fail, the runner calls fail_current_task()
            AND mgr.pause(reason=...). The queue item stays so resume()
            can re-pick it; the cockpit banner explains what failed.
          - Pre-fix behavior was drop-on-fail, which permanently skipped
            failed scenes. Bug 2026-07-22 on proj_a601cee9 left ch5 s2/s3
            stuck at "retry" forever after an LLM connection drop.
